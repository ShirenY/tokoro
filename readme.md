# tokoro
## Overview

**tokoro** is a lightweight, header-only coroutine library designed for modern C++20. Built for game, GUI apps, and any update-driven application. It provides efficient and powerful coroutine scheduling in a single threadâ€”ideal for real-time environments.

### âœ¨ Highlights

* ðŸ”„ **Update-based scheduling** â€“ perfect for frame-driven systems like games or UI rendering.
* âš¡ **Lightweight & efficient** â€“ low memory footprint and minimal scheduling overhead.
* ðŸ§© **Plug-and-play** â€“ just include the header, setup update call, and youâ€™re ready to go.
* ðŸ”§ **Highly customizable** â€“ plug in your own update phases or timers.
* ðŸ§µ **Single-threaded** â€“ less power comes with less responsbility. Sometimes we just want to be safe.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Designed to be lightweight and modular, yet expressive enough to handle complex coroutine flows.

### ðŸš« Non-Goals
Not a coroutine library for maximizing multi-core CPU throughput. ( There are quite some coroutine libraries doing that. ) However, you can still delegate computation to threads and return results into tokoro coroutines.

### Hello tokoro
Here's a short example of how tokoro is used.
```C++
// This example is compilable, make sure you enable the C++ 20 flag.
#include "tokoro.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

using namespace tokoro;
Scheduler schedular;

Async<void> awkwardHello(std::string somebody, double holdSeconds)
{
    std::cout << "Hello, ";
    
    // Just like greeting a coworkerâ€”sometimes you need a moment to recall their name.
    co_await Wait(holdSeconds);
    
    std::cout << somebody << "!" << std::endl;
}

int main()
{    
    schedular.Start(awkwardHello, "tokoro", 1).Forget();
    
    // Simulate a game update loop
    while(true)
    {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(33));
        
        schedular.Update();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## ðŸ“š Tutorial
### Integrate tokoro
**tokoro**Â is a lightweight, header-only library with zero dependencies. To integrate tokoro into your project, simply copy the header files andÂ `#include "tokoro.h"`. Don't forget to add the library directory to your compiler's include search path.

### Decide Scheduler Scope
tokoro::Scheduler can be used locally or globally.

#### Use Scheduler Locally
```c++
// The concept of an Entity is present in nearly every game engine. In Unreal Engine, 
// it is referred to as an Actor, whereas in Unity, it is known as a GameObject. 
// They all get simular update calls from the engine.
class Entity
{
public:
    ...
    virtual void Update()
    {
        schedular.Update();
    }
private:
    ...
    tokoro::Scheduler schedular;
}
```
#### Use Global Singleton Scheduler
```c++
static tokoro::Scheduler& GlobalScheduler() 
{
    static tokoro::Scheduler s;
    return s;
}
...
void Engine::Update()
{
    ...
    GlobalScheduler().Update();
}
```
### Create a Coroutine

A tokoro coroutine contains at leat 2 elements:

1. **Returns Async<T>**. T could be anything support copy or move.
2. Have **at leat one** co_await/co_return.

Below is a bare bone example.

```C++
Async<int> Sqaure(int value) 
{
    co_await tokoro::Wait();
    co_return value * value;
}
```

**Lambda could be coroutines** too. To avoid the famous [pitfall](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/07/10/ways-to-get-dangling-references-with-coroutines/) of using lambda as C++ coroutines, tokoro::Scheduler caches the start lambda with the coroutine object. However regular lambda reference capturing limitation still applies: make sure the references you captured in lambda can last long enough for the lifetime of the coroutine.

**Coroutines can be nested** with co_await. So you can reuse some generic coroutines.
`co_await awkwardHello("you", 1);`

tokoro also have two helper coroutins: `WaitUntil` and `WaitWhile`. They are two contravers coroutines that will keep checking  in every update until input lambda turns true. They are very useful when you want wait for some external signals.
```cpp
co_await WaitUntil([&]()->bool{return launchComplete;});
co_await WaitWhile([&]()->bool{return playingStartCutscene;});
```

In later sections, we will introduce **combination awaiters** `All`&`Any`, with them you can consist even more complex coroutine structures.

### Launch a Coroutine

 `tokoro::Scheduler::Start()` is the only place to launch a **root coroutine**. Root coroutine is a concept we will use throughout this document, which means the coroutine directly started by Scheduler. The coroutines started inside root coroutines is called **sub-coroutines**.  Coroutines can only be exectuted in Scheduler as a root coroutine or under a root coroutine as a sub-coroutine.

```C++
Handle<T> Scheduler::Start(CoroutineFunc, Args ...)
```

`Scheduler::Start()` is a template function, which takes input a function (or functor) to create coroutine. The CoroutineFunc must returns Async\<T\>. The rest arguments is the CoroutineFunc's input parameters. The CoroutineFunc and arguments must be matched.

`Start()` returns a `Handle<T>` that allows you to monitor, stop, or extract the coroutine result. **When the Handle returned goes out of it's scope, it will stop the associated coroutine automatically**. So you should never discard the return value of `Scheduler.Start()`, that will stops the coroutine immediatly. If you just want **fire and forget** the coroutine you can do it with `Handle::Forget()`,
```cpp
Scheduler::Start(Fire).Forget();
```

**Launch coroutine from a member function** could be a bit confusing for some user, here is a example,
```cpp
    class Soldier
    {
    public:
        void StartPatrol(int routeId, int count)
        {
            patroTask = GlobalScheduler().Start(&Soldier::Patrol /*Notice & and Soldier:: scope is must*/, 
                                                this /*Pass this ptr excipitly in first arg*/, 
                                                routeId, /*Rest args are normal method inputs*/
                                                count);
            // Note: Assign with right-value of new handle will cause last coroutine automatically stops.
            // Which is exactly what we want here.
        }

    private:
        Async<void> Patrol(int routeId, int count)
        {
            ...
        }

        Handle<void> patroTask;
    };
```

### Coroutine Lifetimes
The Scheduler manages all root coroutine objects it starts. It keeps them alive until coroutines stopped running. There are three ways for a coroutine to stop.

1. Coroutines returns normally.
2. An exception throw out from a coroutine, and there's no proper catch for it.
3. The associated handle stops the coroutine.
    1. Usually, when the handle go out of its scope, it stops and release the coroutine with RAII.
    2. User can always call `Handle.Stop()` manually to stop the coroutine at anytime.

Just like normal C++, when a root coroutine destroied, the sub-coroutine objects as long as any other objects under the scope of the root coroutine will be destroied recursively. RAII is a recommend way to manage resources since a coroutine can be interrupted anytime by outside manual stop or internal exceptions.

### The Way to Handle It
tokoro::Handle is a simple yet powerful tool to manage coroutines from outside. This section, we will go through each methods of it.

#### Construction&Destruction
`Handle<T>` is a template class, T is the return value of the associated coroutine. Normally, you get a handle by starting a coroutine. The T can get from automatic deduction.
```cpp
auto handle = schedular.Start(DelayAction);
```
You can also declare and initialize a invalid handle by default constructor. Handle dose not have copy constructor, but have a move constructor and a '=' operator overload for move. So there's alway only one handle related to one root coroutine. You can move another handle into a invalid handle.
```cpp
Handle<void> handle; // handle.IsInvalid() == false
handle = schedular.Start(DelayAction); // handle.IsInvalid() == true
```
When Handle destroid, its destructor will release associated coroutine. But scheduler will keep running them until they reach the end. So you can run a coroutine but discard the handle if you don't care how it runs nor its returns.
```cpp
schedular.Start(DelayAction); // Handle is discard, but the coroutine will keep running to its end.
```
However, it's not a recommend practice to headlessly discard most handles. Make sure you know your coroutine's lifetime and status is important to write robust coroutine logic. We will talk about this later in Best Practice section.

#### bool Handle::IsValid()
`IsValid()` tells you whether the handle is get from Scheduler::Start(). No coroutine or Scheduler status related.

#### void Handle::Stop()
`Stop()` is the way to stop suspended coroutine from outside. This only function is the whole tokoro's cancelation system. tokoro do not take the current popular cancel token philosophy, relys on RAII and suspend point to safely stop coroutines. So you don't need to manage these annoying cancel tokens, and passing them down in your nested coroutines recursively. Stop mechanic removed a lot of pain of cancel token system, in most coroutines you don't need to do anything. ( Focus on single thread helps us to achieve this.) However for some coroutines, you still need to take care your resource releases and state rollback with RAII. We will talk in detail in the Best Practice section.

#### std::optional\<AsyncState\> Handle::GetState()
`GetState()` actually consist two layer of information. When it returns std::nullopt, it means either the handle is invalid or the associated scheduler is destroyed. To distinguish between these two state, you only need to get confirm from `IsInvilad()`. On the other hand, AsyncState tells you the state of the coroutine,

* Running: every coroutine starts with Running state. But you shouldn't a assume every new started Handle will returns Running immediatly. Because the coroutine might already reached its end in the Scheduler::Start().
* Succeed: means a coroutine finished execution without exceptions.
* Failed: a exception throw out in executing this coroutine and it's not catch internally. Call `Hanle::TakeResult()` will rethrow the exception to outside.
* Stopped: the coroutine is stopped manually by Handle::Stop().

**Note**: You can get a AsyncState from the handle, does not mean the underlying coroutine object is still there. It might be already destroyed, refer to Coroutine Lifetimes.

#### bool Handle::IsRunning()
Sometimes keep writing
```cpp
auto state = handle.GetState();
if (state.has_value() && *state == AsyncState::Running)
    ...
```
is just too annoying. So `IsRunning()` is the short-term of above. 

#### std::optional\<T\> Handle::TakeResult()
`TakeResult()` is a one time call. As the name says, it will take out the return of the coroutine return it to caller. So if your coroutine do produced a return, the first call will give you the result, the second call will returns std::nullopt.
However, when the coroutine is still running, TakeResult will also returns nullopt. To tell whether it's already taken, you can call `IsRunning()` to make sure.
If a coroutine is ended with a unhandled exception, TakeResult() will throw it out. The throw is one time too.

#### Handle::Forget()
As state in previous, `Forget()` usually used when you do **Fire and Forget** coroutines. However, you can still keep using the handle after `Forget()`. **All the other functions will still work as expected after you forget**.
`Forget()` is usually risky if your coroutine has dependencies to outside of the coroutine, they usually do in game applications. So thing twice when you want a Fire and Forget.

### Waiters
Currently there are only 3 kind of awaiters you can explicitly used in tokoro (there are some implicity awaiters, but you don't need to care as a library user.)

#### Wait
`Wait` is the most important awaiter for tokoro. There's two way to use `Wait`:

1. `co_await Wait();` will suspend the current coroutine until next Scheduler::Update().
2.  `co_await Wait(double sec);` will suspend the current coroutine and add it to scheduler's time queue. In which the coroutine will get resumed `sec` seconds later in Scheduler::Update().

Note internally the time queue only check and resume coroutines who need to get resumed in current time point. So performance wise, a `Wait(max_double)` only cost the queue insert time and a few bytes of queue node memory, no other impact in regular update.
You can also specify which custom update type and time type for the `Wait(UpdateType, TimeType)`.  Please check Custom Update Types if you want use your own update types and timers.

#### All
All will wait for all coroutines it holds to finish. The return is a tuple which holds all returns of each sub-coroutines.
```cpp
auto [terrain, texture] = co_await All(GenerateTerrain(), LoadTexture(path));
```

#### Any
Any wait until any of its sub-coroutine finish. The return is a tuple with std::optional<T>, T is each coroutines' return type. You can check tuple's element one by one to find out which coroutine returned first.
```cpp
auto [texture, timeout] = co_await All(LoadMesh(meshPath), Delay(10));
if(timeout.has_value())
{
    LOG_Error("Timeout after 10 second when try to load %s", meshPath);
}
```
Note that, **when any of the coroutine returned, all the other sub-coroutines are immdediatly stopped** by this awaiter.
If you do need other coroutines to keep running after Any awaiter, you have to start them as root coroutines, and wait for their handle instead.

```cpp
Handle<Mesh> handle1 = GlobalScheduler().Start(LoadMesh, mesh1);
Handle<Mesh> handle2 = GlobalScheduler().Start(LoadMesh, mesh2);
// You can probably co_await WaitWhile([&](){return handle1.IsRunning() || handle2.IsRunning()});
// But this is just a example.
auto [handle1Finished, handle2Finished] = co_await All(WaitWhile([&](){return handle1.IsRunning()}), WaitWhile([&](){return handle2.IsRunning()}));

if(handle1Finished.has_value())
{
    LOG("%s loaded first", mesh1);
}
else
{
    LOG("%s loaded first", mesh2);
}
```

### Custom Updates
tokoro gives user the default Scheduler for them to start using coroutines in application who only have one regular update event. However most current day's game engine have more than that, like in Unity there's Update, LateUpdate, FixedUpdate. Also there are realtime and game time two different timer in Unity (The later one can be paused) , we want to support all that too. 
Adding all of these events and timers of all engines to tokoro will confuse users who does not need them. So tokoro has a way to let user custom their own update. Here is a example, there's some constrains that is not verifable by compilers, please read the comments carefully.
```cpp
enum class UpdateType
{
    Update = 0, // Update type start with 0 value, the zero enum will be taken as default.
    PreUpdate,
    PostUpdate,
    Count, // Count at last of enum is a must have for tokoro.
};

enum class TimeType
{
    EmuRealTime = 0, // Time type should start with 0 value too, the zero enum will be taken as default.
    GameTime,
    Count, // Count at last of enum is a must have for tokoro.
};

// Give alias names for ease of life. Prefix BP is for Blueprint.
//
// Note: You can still use Scheduler, Wait if you really like these names.
// Just don't introduce 'using namespace tokoro' to your code.
using MyScheduler = SchedulerBP<UpdateType, TimeType>;
using MyWait      = WaitBP<UpdateType, TimeType>;

// There's no way to give alias to functions in C++, so we have to use function ptr for WaitUntil & WaitWhile.
// Also because of that, WaitUntilBP and WaitWhileBP does not support to resume at a user wanted CustomUpdate.
// But it's very easy to implement one if you look into WaitUntilBP's implement, it's literally 2 lines of code.
inline auto MyWaitUntil = WaitUntilBP<UpdateType, TimeType>;
inline auto MyWaitWhile = WaitWhileBP<UpdateType, TimeType>;

MyScheduler sched;
double emuRealTime = 0;
double gameTime = 0;
bool gamePaused = false;

int main()
{
    ... 
        
    // SetCustomTimer accept a get function of the time: double getTime()
    // Note: this timer is only for test,
    // in most applications the default timer is good enough for 'real time'
    sched.SetCustomTimer(TimeType::EmuRealTime, [&]() -> double { return emuRealTime; });
    sched.SetCustomTimer(TimeType::GameTime, [&]() -> double { return gameTime; });    
    
    // Simulate a game engine loop
    while(true)
    {
        emuRealTime += frameTime;
        if (!gamePaused)
            gameTime += frameTime;

        ...

        // It's your responsibility to setup all Update calls in the engine. The compiler have no way to detect if all Update types are called.
        // If you have some update in other threads, you have to setup the sync point with your 'main' gameplay threads with mutex, to call
        // these Updates. Just like how Unity do with their FixedUpdate. Scheduler is NOT thread safe.
        sched.Update(UpdateType::PreUpdate, TimeType::EmuRealTime);
        sched.Update(UpdateType::PreUpdate, TimeType::GameTime);

        sched.Update(UpdateType::Update, TimeType::EmuRealTime);
        sched.Update(UpdateType::Update, TimeType::GameTime);

        sched.Update(UpdateType::PostUpdate, TimeType::EmuRealTime);
        sched.Update(UpdateType::PostUpdate, TimeType::GameTime);

        ...
    }
}

// Some where in your game, you can have coroutines like this,
 Handle handle = sched.Start([&]() -> Async<void> {
     co_await MyWait(UpdateType::PreUpdate); // Wait next PreUpdate
     co_await MyWait(UpdateType::Update); // Wait next Update
     co_await MyWait(UpdateType::PostUpdate); // Wait next PostUpdate
     co_await MyWait(1, UpdateType::Update, TimeType::GameTime); // Wait for 1 sec in GameTime, and resume in Update.
     co_await MyWait(1); // Use default parameters of update and time, equals to MyWait(1, UpdateType::Update, TimeType::EmuRealTime)
 }).Forget();
```

### Execution Flow
It may looks obvious, but I feel it's nesessary to clarify when will a coroutine returns it's execution control and game loop can continue process. 
Coroutines start executing immediatly when they created by `Scheduler.Start` or parent coroutine. They only suspend and return control to main thread when `co_await Wait(...)`. Look at the code below,
```cpp
scheduler.Start([]()->Async<void>{
	std::cout<< "Current Frame: " << Time.Frame() << std::endl;

    co_await []()->Async<void>{
    	std::cout<< "Current Frame: " << Time.Frame() << std::endl;
        co_await Wait(); // Suspend for next update.
        std::cout<< "Current Frame: " << Time.Frame() << std::endl;
    }
    
	std::cout<< "Current Frame: " << Time.Frame() << std::endl;
}).Forget();
```
Assume the scheduler.Start is called in frame 10, the console would show:
```bash
Current Frame: 10
Current Frame: 10
Current Frame: 11
Current Frame: 11
```

### Exceptions
tokoro have complete exception support ( I personally don't get why people want to use exception in C++ games, but implement it anyway ðŸ˜† ). When a exception thrown, it will be pass upward all the way to the root coroutine if no proper try catched it. In that throw up process all objects will be destroyed just like exceptions in a normal function call, so it's important to use RAII to clear things up. If no one catch the exception inside the coroutine, the root coroutine will be end with AsyncState::Failed. No result will be return from it. 
Howevery, if you call `Handle::TakeResult()` of that failed coroutine, the saved exception will be rethrown for once. So that the program can catch and process this exception outside of coroutine.
Not specific to tokoro, but I need to metion that, exceptions will crash the application if you compile your C++ code with no-exception options.

## Performance
Performance cost for scheduling is one of most significant measurement for coroutine system in game applications. tokoro makes sure the cpu cost for scheduling one resume is O(logN). The Fibonacci coroutines stress test in TestCoroutine.cpp is designed to test the scheduling performance of tokoro. It shows that for 10000 running coroutines who randomly resumed in 1 sec each time, the max update stop is only 0.35ms, 2.1% of a 60 fps refresh time. More than enough for heavy coroutine usage in games.

## FAQ
#### What's the point for single threaded coroutings?
Coroutine feature normally used for utilize multi-thread cpus, however because coroutine is a automatically localized state machine, it is very good to implement gameplay logics, which are always break by frames. By focusing on single thread frame scheduling, users can get ride of concurrent data racing issues, focusing on gameplay. Makes the code easy to understand and high cohesion.

#### How to debug?
Debuging in C++ coroutines are much more hard compare to normal functions, because of two issues,

1. No local variables to watch like normal functions.
2. No stack tracing to look for call up chain like normal functions.
The 1st one might get be better if popular debugers gets better on read coroutine state variables, but for now, in most debuger, you have look into these compiler generated structures for yourself.
The 2nd issue are more complicated, there's besically no way in coroutines to show a 'call stack' for the call up chain. Because coroutine's callstack are just different, it takes time to get use to it, all the languages have coroutines have same issue. Maybe we can have some macro tools to save the calling chain, but I haven't found a alegent way to do that.

## Best Practices
Coroutines can be so easy and nice, that beginners tends to abuse it in the project. There's some tips from me you can checkout.

#### Always make sure your coroutine's dependency live longer than your coroutines.
The dependency here means the references or pointers the coroutine is using. Whenever a coroutine have ref or pointer pointing to outside of the coroutine memory, you have to look carefully will your coroutine live longer than them. Once it happens, it will lead to invalid memory access. This issue can easily get overlooked for beginners, because the delay execution nature of coroutines. You can take advantage of Handle's RAII mechanic, to make sure once the dependencies are freed, the coroutine is freed too.

#### Single thread means no concurrent issues, but you still need to take care the shared status.
As the previous one states, the ref and pointers to outside a coroutine can lead to issues. In tokoro, because most of thing are running in single thread, user don't need to think about mutex and atomic. But if other part of your program is also changing same memory your coroutine are using, it can easily lead to data curruption. For example,
```cpp
Async<Entity> FindEnemy()
{
    for(auto& entity : currentVisibleEntities)
    {
        if(IsEnemy(entity))
            co_return entity;
        
        co_await Wait(); // Yield for one frame for smooth frame cost.
    }

    co_return None;
}
```
In the code above, it's intend to check one entity in one frame, so that the cost can be ease across frames. However, currentVisibleEntities is a container keep changing by this entity's other components, so the iterator the for loop is using can become corrupted. There's no golden rules to deal with these data issues, you have to design a way suit for your own situation. For this special case, it can change to use the current checking index as a iter, and check whether it still valid every frame. 
You can still use other threading tools in tokoro, you just need to launch them in coroutine and use WaitUntil/WaitWhile to check if it finished every frame.

#### Be alert with coroutines that can run multiple instances at same time.
In previous tip, we said have shared and changing data accessing can be dangerous. If a coroutine read from same data, but can launch to has mutiple instance running at same time, it can easily have shared changing data. If there's only two instances of same coroutine, maybe it's still fine to manage the shared data between them. But good luck if you got more than that. One simple rule is, if your coroutine is changing shared data, don't launching mutiple of them. You can save a Handle of it to tell is it save to launch second one, or you can always use the later one to replace to older one, it's up to you. On the other hand, if the coroutine don't have shared data rw, or only read from them, there's no problem to have muti instances at same time. Note, you still need to take care of the issue in previous tip.

#### Coroutines are infectious
To use a `Async<T> func()`, you either use Scheduler.Start() to launch and wait for it with Handle or you just `co_await` it in another `Async\<T\>` fucntion. Sometimes it seems easier to make your function become Async\<T\>, so you don't have to mess up with Scheduler or Handle, let your method's use to worry about it. If people keep thinking in this way, you will find that slowly, all of your 'normal' functions will return Async\<T\>. Is it good? No. If you read all the previous tips in this section, you will come to a idea that coroutine is not a silver bullet for everything. If everything become `Async\<T\>`, it will be no way for you to track when a coroutine will return, what shared data does it use, can it be use with mutiple instances, your project will become a mess. So the project should have very restricted rules on what things can be `Async\<T\>`. If a method could be 'normal' it has to be 'normal'. If the logic you are implmenting need use coroutine, it's better to keep the `Async\<T\>` method private to you, and let other use the normal APIs you expose to them.

## Roadmap
Currently, tokoro can be considered feature complete. Howevery there's some direction I want to investigate. So these things are not gunreeteed to be in the library, but I gland to if we find out a nice way to add them.

* Optimize the allocation performance when insert to TimeQueue of scheduler: Currently it utilized std::mutiset. This container suits our purpose very well, however, it need to do dynamic allocation for every insert. I want to find a way to optimize it futher more.
* Implement Callback Awaiter. Callback Awaiter is a awaiter for user to wait for external signels. Game engine or frameworks can make use of it as a base to implement their own awiaters. For example AnimationAwaiters can let user `co_await Entity.Play("Die")`. Currently you can use WaitUntil/WaitWhile to achieve similiar functionlity. Howevery, they need get resumed every frame to check if the flag turns. A Callback Awaiter can let user tell the coroutine to resume in next update without constantly checking.
* ThreadPool Awaiter. tokoro focusing on single thread coroutines, but that doesn't mean we refuse to have some convinient thread pool tool to dispatch heavy cpu tasks. However, find out a way to do it without effecting single thread performance can be a chanllenge.
* Utilities to help track the callup chain of nested coroutines for debug.

## Inspiring
tokoro is inspired by Unity's coroutine system and it's superum successor UniTask.

## Platform Compatibility
tokoro should work on any platform support C++ 20 coroutines. Test runs on linxu/mac/windows. Other platforms need more feed back from community.

## License
tokoro use MIT license.
